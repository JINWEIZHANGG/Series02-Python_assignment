# Sinusoid Wave Generator for Python 

This script creates sinusoidal waves based on user-defined parameters (e.g., frequency, amplitude, phase). It includes functions for wave generation and visualization, making it easy to experiment with different sinusoid configurations.

Adjust frequency to change the number of cycles per second.
Modify amplitude to make the wave taller or shorter.
Use phase to shift the wave horizontally (unit: radians).
Change duration to adjust the time length of the wave.
Adjust sampling_rate to modify resolution (higher values result in smoother waves).
Use displacement to move the entire wave up or down.
The shift parameter can be used to add an additional horizontal offset (unit: seconds).

# By modifying these parameters, you can create a wide range of sinusoidal wave patterns for applications like signal processing, acoustics, or education.
